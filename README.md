# TheGameOfMorra
Morra is a hand game that dates back thousands of years. The rules are simple. If a two
player game, each player (at the same time) must reveal their hand holding out zero to
five fingers; at the same time, they must call out their guess about how many fingers
total will be revealed by both players. If a player guesses correctly, they win a point. If
both players guess correctly, no points are awarded. If no one guesses correctly, no
points are awarded. The total number of points to win is determined before the game
starts.
